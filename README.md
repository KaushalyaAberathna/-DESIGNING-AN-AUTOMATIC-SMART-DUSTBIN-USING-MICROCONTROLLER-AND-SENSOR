 DESIGNING AN AUTOMATIC SMART DUSTBIN  USING MICROCONTROLLER AND SENSOR
 
#Introduction
This project aims to develop an Automatic Smart Dustbin integrated with IoT technology to enhance waste management efficiency, reduce human intervention, and improve hygiene. The system is built using an ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, and Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor and report bin status in real time.

#Features
1.Ultrasonic Sensor – Detects the fill level of the dustbin.
2.Servo Motor – Automatically opens and closes the lid when motion is detected.
3.Wi-Fi Connectivity – Sends real-time alerts to a central server or mobile app when the bin is full.
4.Battery Powered System – Supports sustainability with an option for solar charging.
5.LED Indicators – Displays bin status (e.g., green for empty, red for full).
6.Optional Upgrades – Gas sensors for odor detection and municipal waste management system integration.

#Target Audience
*Urban residential areas
*Offices and commercial spaces
*Smart city initiatives
